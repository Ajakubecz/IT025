# Summary
LucidChart was pretty fun and I learned how to use it. It was cool to learn how it works and how easy it was to use.
# Introduction to Networking
# Network Hardware
Unlike a hub, a switch in intelligent. It stores the data called mac address' and when the data packet is sent to the port, the switch sends the data out a specific port. Unlike a hub where it broadcasts the data out of every port.
A router forwards data from one network to another. The benefit of a router over switches and hubs is that when the router receives the data packet, the router then inspects the IP address and then determines if it was for its own network or another network. If the data packet is in fact for its own network, it receives it, if it is not then it sends it off to another network.
# Network Topologies
If the central hub goes down, this is called a single point failure. This effects Star topology, ring topology, and bus topology. 
Infrastructure is both physically wired and wireless, the computers are physically connected to a switch. Wireless mesh are wirelessly connected to eachother. If you wanted modems throught your home or business, you do not have to run wires to each modem, saving time and money. 
# Data Transmission
IP address matches with Number 3. Unique identifying number 
Packet matches with number 4.Unique identifying number 
Protocol matches number 1.Set of rules to allow devices to communicate 
Packet switching matches with number 2 Unit of data 
DNS matches number 5. Directory of IP address common names.  For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com
# NSA/CSS
The NSA's role in cybersecurity is very important. They Protect us from the terrorist and criminals who try to hack our personal information. NSA protects us by using cybersecurity, cybersecurity is used in ways such as protecting our hardware, software, or electronic data.
