# Executive Summary
I explain about what ERP stands for and how Virtualization is important. I will explore the website College Central and also find out about where to get certificates easier through school. Co-ops and internships are very important. I will go over those as well.
# Software
Applications such as Spreadsheet, allows us to do number calculations and analysis. Operating systems can manage your hardware resources, provide user-interface and even give a platform for software developers write applications on. Examples of this are Microsoft windows and Apple's OS X. Utility is software that allows you to fix or modify your computer in some way. An example is antivirus software.
ERP stands for Enterprise Resource Planning. This is a software application made to bring together an entire organization. An example is a small company using ERP, it consolidate all of the information systems into one. 
Virtualization is sharing information through physical infrastructure, cloud computing is delivers shared data through the internet. The purpose of virtualization is to help go around the fact that storage and high processing costs an arm and a leg. By using virtualization, you can run more than 1 virtual system on a server. 
# Virtualization
Virtualization lets you use your servers to do more tasks than you could before. Saving time and money. Hypervision's purpose is to give multiple users simultaneous access to computers that performed batch processing. 
# Python
The pseudo-code meaning behind Python is to concentrate on the solution to the problem rather than the language itself.
An interpreted language is a program in a language like C or C++, converted from language C or C++ into a language that is binary for the computer to read, using a compiler with various flags and options. Python you just run the source directly from the code.
# Career Exploration
# College Central
On the college Central website I found there are many internships I can apply for once I get close to ending my schooling or when I get out of school with my degree. 
I found that web developers with an Associates Degree out of college make $69,430 a year on average. My boyfriend who has no college education, but did go to a trades school. He is a web and applications developer, has found that with 6 years of experience ranks you as a "seasoned" developer. This would mean he has back end and front end experience so he makes a lot more money than those just starting out with a degree.
# Certifications
The certification for CompTIA CySA+ allows you to perform data analysis and interpret the results to identify vulnerabilities, threats and risks to an organization.
# Certificates
Web Design & Development has a course in Building Websites with WordPress. I have always found it so interesting what goes into building a website, I love the instant gratification from doing it. I like to see my work.
# Co-ops / Internships
In order to be co-op ready, I must have completed 12 credit hours of college coursework with at least two courses related my major field and have a GPA of 2.75 or higher. The benefits of a co-op or internship is that I would be able to work in the field and have hands on while either still completing me degree or just after college. That can get my name out there and show how hard of a worker I am.
# Industry Associations / Student Organizations
I chose IEEE because they are a group for technology driver members. They are there to be the trusted voice for engineering,computing, etc. This would be benificial because it would help a student get recognition, they have over 600 different programs for the student to try. Between certificates and their learning program.
# Summary
I learned about Python, how much easier it is to use over some other languages. I have tried to do some programming in the past and it was a bit confusing. This is much easier. College Central is a very helpful website that I will use during my school year and after. It helped me learn about internships all over and for different degrees, if I don't end up staying in this mayjor.
