# Executive Summary 
I will use Python and learn about Shell and IDLE. I will explain the differences between a Raster image and a Vector image. I then create my own logo.
# Python IDLE
The Shell is good for running Python instructions one at a time, where the file editer is where you would write entire Python programs.
Python IDLE
A Variable is created the first time a value is stored in it. Spam, bacon and eggs and from Monty Python.
 An assignment statement consists of a variable name, an equal sign, and the value to be stored. An example of this is spam = 'Hello' spam + ' world' .
An example is string function these can be passed an integer value and will evaluate to a string value version of it. 
Three common data types are Integers, Floating-point numbers and Strings.
# Graphics
Raster images you can not see the pixels until you zoom in on the picture. Vector images you can make any size and there is no pixelation. Vector images are appropriate for professional situations, as to where Raster would be appropriate if there would not have to be any modifications done to the image.
It matters to some developers between lossy and lossless because of the data size. Lossless takes runs of data and stores them in a single data value and count. Lossy has a method of reducing the imageâ€™s color space to the most common colors within the image.
GIF allows an animated image and stores up to 8 bits per pixel, jpg is a format that uses lossy compression to create smaller file sizes. Pngs biggest advantages is that it supports a number of transparency options, including alpha channel transparency.
# File Properties
I used 3 layers, my design was Ooga booga from the game Crash bandicoot.
The file size is 11 kg and the application it offers to open with is Visual Studie Code. Visual Studio does not read the image and will not open the picture. I chose to open it in Google Chrome and I then had no issues opening and viewing my logo.
# Conclusion
I am enjoying learning about Python and all the things it can do. I did not know Python was based so much on Monty Python. My parents watched it so I watched it often growing up, It is neat to learn about a programming tool based off the show and movies. I got to create my own logo and learn about the layers that go into them. I found out how to change my preffered settings when opening an image or file.
