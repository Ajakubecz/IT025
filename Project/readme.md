# Summary
I chose option 1, I was unable to Participate in the co-op orientation process through the Career Center and I was unsure of how to fill out a "Cooperative Education Agreement" form , But I completed the rest of the tasks. 
# Project or Co-op
The co-op readiness expierience was good, I am excited to get into a co-op and actually see how the field will be. 
# Conclusion
My experience in the course was great, I ran into some issues with time since starting a new job so this was my fault not the teacher or course. The class was pretty easy and I feel I learned a lot. It has helped me see that I do like the IT field and I plan on taking the free course through Microsoft to try doing AI with Python, Python seems pretty easy to use and I did like it the little bit we were able to use it.
