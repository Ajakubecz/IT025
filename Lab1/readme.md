# H1 Excecutive Summary
My lab is about gas pumps. I will explain how the hardware is used to pump the gas, how the software will collect data from you, the person and then charge your account. 
# H1 Information Systems Componets 
An Information Systems Component that I use everyday is a gas-pump. The hardware we use is a keypad and credit card slot on the outside. The software that is used is the process to accept your card number and pin, then it counts the gallons and dollars being rung up while your gas is being pumped by the hardware that is the gas pump. It collects your date, this is your card number and either zip code or pin number. This then charges your credit card by sending a transaction through the software.
# H1 Git Hub
Client - Server Architecture. The client side of GitHub is me being able to use the website and create a repository for my project and type code. The Server side is GitHub is them having the access of the web page and I am able to connect with others through their servers.
Cloud Computing - Github is considering "Cloud Computing" because they store all the data on The Cloud instead of my device and software. Google drive is another Cloud Computing environment.
