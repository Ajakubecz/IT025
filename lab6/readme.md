# Internet Protocol
An IP address is the unique numbers assigned to every computer or device that is connected to the Internet.

The problem with this approach is that it very inflexible, as any changes require changing the entire application and protocol software. The programs that run on the application process are SMTP, FTP, HTTP,POP3,IMAP4 and SNMP.
