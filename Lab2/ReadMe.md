# Executive Summary
My Lab will include me explaining how I think the hardware and memory will work in a computer. I will also explain how increasing RAM in a computer will help boost the speed. I go on to tell about the difference in Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal.
# Hardware
Hard Drives and Memory
The Hard Drive Latency is measured in millaseconds, as to where the Disc Tranfer rate is measured in megabytes per minute (MBps). Hard Drive Latency measures how long it takes the hard drive's read/write head to find the location of the piece of data on the disc. The Disc transfer rate is the speed in which data is tranferred to and from the Disk Media.
Hard disk drive need to be spinning in order to collect data, this takes longer. It also has to spin at the correct speed in order to read the data that is stored on it correctly. Where a Solid State Hard Drives data can be stored immediately due to no spinning disc, it uses Synchronous dynamic random access memory.
RAM- Increasing RAM makes the computer run faster because without the extra RAM, the data would have to go back to the hard drive, causing the computer to slow down.
The difference between 64 and 32 bit paths is 32 bit paths is an older clock cycle called sims and it only transferred 32 bits of data at a time. 64 bit path is a new clock cycle called DIMM that trasnfers 64 bits of data at a time.
# Alu And The Unit Control
There are 8 wires coming out of the ALU that run to the Register, the register stores a number temporarily. The ALU sends the output to the register but it doesn't get saved until the Control Unit turns on the set wire. Oncfe the set wire is turned on, it saves whatever number is on the imput wire and is sent through the enable wire. The register wire is then connected to the BUS on the motherboard.
# CPU, Input & Output
As I am using the self checkout, the input of the machine would be me scanning the barcode of those items.  The CPU would be where all of the prices of my groceries get tallied up for me to then, get the total of everything. The output would be the machine spitting out a receipt of my total list of purchased groceries.
# Login Gates and Circuits
The NAND gate is opposite to the AND gate.
# IEEE- Ethically Alligned Design
IEEE is a service dedicated to advancing innovation and technology. The importance of ethics in device design is device design works with clients and colleagues. You have to be accountable for your planning and conceiving.
# Data Representation
Numeric Conversions. Decimal is numbers that we use, Base 10. Binary is the conversion that we use to turn a decimal into. Computers read in binary. Hexadecimal is Binary and letters. 0123456789ABCDEF.
# Hexadecimal Color Representation
The color is composed of RGB colors 100% red, 0.4% green and 42% blue. The CMYK colors are composed of 0% cyan, 99.6% magenta, 58% yellow and 0% black. The using the color #ff016b on website representation, it would be problematic. The color Red (positive) does not have enough of magenta(subtractive) color to go with it. The color contrast ratio that is minimum to be acceptable is 4.5:1. This color VIVID PINK did not fit that description.
# Conclusion
In Conclusion, I have found out how to use Hexadecimal properly. I have also learned that IEEE is a service for people advancing in the tech world.
