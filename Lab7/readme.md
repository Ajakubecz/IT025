# File Compression
Compressed files are used to take up less space while still holding all the content. You can add several files in a compressed file and it will take up less space.
The file size is 11kb or 10,000 bytes, once compressed the file is 4 kb or 4,203 bytes.
# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
