# File Compression
Compressed files are used to take up less space while still holding all the content. You can add several files in a compressed file and it will take up less space.
The file size is 11kb or 10,000 bytes, once compressed the file is 4 kb or 4,203 bytes.
# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
Methods are a special kind of function that are defined within a class. The Shark object sammy is using the two methods swim() and be_awesome()
# Unified Modeling Language (UML) 
The Unified Modeling Language (UML) was created to forge a common, semantically and syntactically rich visual modeling language for the architecture, design, and implementation of complex software systems both structurally and behaviorally. OMG is Providing system architects, software engineers, and software developers with tools for analysis, design, and implementation of software-based systems as well as for modeling business and similar processes.
The class is Shark, the object is sammy, encapsulation and inheritance are definition of a shark and swim(self), and a specific type of shark is abstraction.
# Conclusion
Using OOP was neat and I enjoyed learning more about python.
